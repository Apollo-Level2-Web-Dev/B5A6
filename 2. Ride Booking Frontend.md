## üöñ Ride Management System ‚Äì Frontend Requirements (React + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query)

### **Project Overview**

Develop a **production-grade**, fully responsive, and role-based full stack application for a **Ride Booking Platform** (similar to **Uber** or **Pathao**) using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and RTK Query.

The frontend will interact with the **Ride Booking Backend API** to support distinct user experiences for **Riders**, **Drivers**, and **Admins**, ensuring a consistent, polished, and intuitive UI/UX across all devices.

You will create:

- A **public landing experience** introducing the ride booking system
- A **role-based dashboard interface** with tailored features for each user type
- Robust **state management and API integration** via Redux Toolkit & RTK Query
- Responsive UI and polished UX

---

### **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend Framework**: React (with React Router for routing)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, Axios (optional)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with responsive utility classes) or other css frameworks
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express, MongoDB, JWT + bcrypt (Secure Authentication)
- **Optional Enhancements**: intro.js / hopscotch.js (guided tours), recharts (data visualization), react-hot-toast (notifications)

### **üìå Core Functional Requirements**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive Design & Visual Consistency**

- Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Consistent typography, spacing, and color palette across all pages.
- Sticky navigation bar with at least 6 clearly menu option routes and dropdown menu if required.
- Footer designed to complement the theme and include functional links.
- Improving performance through lazy-loading or skeleton loaders and ensure accessibility standards are met.
- Populating the project with real or realistic data while avoiding placeholder text to give a professional finish.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Public Landing Pages/Homepage**

Accessible without authentication:

- **Home** ‚Äì Must include **at least 5 distinct, well-structured sections** (excluding navbar and footer).
    - **Examples:** Hero Banner, How-it-works Overview, Service Highlights, Customer Feedback/Testimonials, Call-to-action Prompts, or Promotions/Special Offers.
- **About Us** ‚Äì Company background, mission, and team profiles.
- **Features** ‚Äì Detailed breakdown of Rider, Driver and Admin capabilities.
- **Contact** ‚Äì Validated form for inquiries (simulated submission).
- **FAQ** ‚Äì Searchable list of common questions.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication & Authorization**

- JWT-based login and registration with role selection (`Rider`,`Driver`or`Admin`).
- Registration form with role selection (`Rider`and`Driver`).
- Google/Facebook login integration is optional. (However, if it is implemented, it must appropriately manage user roles)
- Role-based landing pages upon login.
- Account Status Handling:
    - Blocked or Suspended Users:
        - Redirected to a dedicated status page instead of accessing dashboards. This page must display the account status and provide instructions or contact details to resolve the issue.
    - Offline Drivers **(Offline indicates that the driver does not wish to receive any ride requests from riders):**
        - Can still access all dashboard pages except features directly related to ride acceptance (e.g., incoming ride requests and accept buttons). Instead of showing those features, display a notice prompting them to go online to receive rides.
- Persistent authentication state across sessions.
- Logout functionality

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Rider Features**

- **Ride Request Form**: Pickup and destination fields, fare estimation, payment method selection.
- **Live Ride Tracking**: Ongoing ride updates with real time map with driver details. (Optional)
- **Ride History**: Paginated list with search and filters (date, fare range, status).
- **Ride Details Page**: Map route (optional), timestamps, driver info, and ride status timeline.
- **Profile Management**: Edit Name, Phone Number, and Change Password.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Driver Features**

- **Availability Control**: Online/Offline Toggle.
- **Incoming Requests**: Accept or Reject rider offers.
- **Active Ride Management**: Update statuses (Accepted ‚Üí Picked Up ‚Üí In Transit ‚Üí Completed) or (Cancelled).
- **Earnings Dashboard**: Visual breakdown (daily, weekly, monthly) with charts.
- **Ride History**: Paginated and filterable past ride records.
- **Profile Management**: Vehicle details, contact info, and password updates.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Features**

- **User Management**: Search, filter, block/unblock riders, approve/suspend drivers.
- **Ride Oversight**: View all rides with advanced filtering by date, status, driver, or rider.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Data visualizations for ride volume, revenue trends, and driver activity.
- **Search & Filter Tools**: Consistent across all admin listing pages.
- **Profile Management**:  Update personal profile and password.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ General UI/UX Enhancements**

- Role-based navigation with profile dropdown.
- Interactive elements: carousels, dynamic ride cards, and responsive charts.
- Skeleton and smooth transitions for enhanced perceived performance and global error handling.
- No broken links or non-functional buttons.
- Accessibility-compliant components and semantic HTML.
- Lazy-loading for heavy assets (maps, large tables).
- Data visualization components like cards, bar charts, pie charts, and tables‚Äîall dynamically updated.
- **Guided Tour** (intro.js / hopscotch.js):
    - At least 5 steps highlighting important features for first-time users.
    - Suggested steps:
        1. Navigation menu ‚Äì explain how to switch between sections.
        2. Ride request form ‚Äì guide through pickup, destination, and fare estimate.
        3. Active ride tracking ‚Äì show map or ride status updates.
        4. Ride history filters ‚Äì demonstrate search and filtering.
        5. Driver availability toggle ‚Äì explain how to go online/offline.
    - Attach tour steps to actual DOM elements.
    - Run tour automatically for new users (store completion in `localStorage`).
    - Include a ‚ÄúRestart Tour‚Äù option in settings.
    - Ensure tooltip styling matches the site‚Äôs theme.
- **Strict Error Handling (‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for Full Marks)**:
    - All **forms must implement proper validation and error messages** (e.g., required fields, invalid email, password mismatch).
    - Clear and user-friendly error messages for network/API failures, validation errors, and unauthorized actions.
    - Toast/alert message for both success and error states (e.g., `react-hot-toast`).
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If you fail to handle form validation errors or API errors properly, **your marks will be significantly reduced.**
